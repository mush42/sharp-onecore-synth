# Sharp Onecore Synthesizer
A wrapper around UWP's one-core mobile voices

This project provides .NET applications with easier access to the new mobile voices included with Windows 10 (otherwise known as Windows one-core synthesizer). The API is heavily inspired by that of System.Speech.Synthesis namespace.

This library  is developed as a part of the [Bookworm Project](https://github.com/mush42/bookworm/), which aims at providing blind and visually impaired individuals with a universally accessible, comprehensive eBook reading solution.
